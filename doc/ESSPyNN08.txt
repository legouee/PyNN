==================================
Installation of the ESS (PyNN 0.8)
==================================

By following this guideline, you will successfully install the current (october 2014) symap2ic software stack of Heidelberg, containing the ESS, emulator of the BrainScaleS hardware. You will have installed it together with the compatible PyNN version (0.8). As agreed during the Barcelona BrainScaleS workshop, for all the BrainScaleS demos, having the relevant parts of the model run on this ESS is a requirement for everybody who wants to run the neural model on the true hardware.

In the year 2014, a new software stack, the PyHMF, will be released by the Heidelberg team. It will be compatible with PyNN 0.8.

Prerequisites (tested on a naive Ubuntu saucy 13.10 on a 64-bit machine)
------------------------------------------------------------------------

To be able to configure and compile the symap2ic project, you need to install the following libraries::

   apt-get -y install git python-pip python-dev build-essential libgtest-dev libboost-all-dev libpng12-dev libssl-dev libmongo-client-dev mongodb liblog4cxx10-dev autotools-dev automake

The ESS expects the 64-bit libraries to lie either in /lib64 or /usr/lib64. However, in Ubuntu 13.10, the 64-bit libraries lie in /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu. So, yo u need to make the following symbolic links::

   ln -s /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu /usr/lib64
   ln -s /usr/lib/libmongoclient.a /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libmongoclient.a

To be able to run the tests and to use the ESS, you also need to install::

   apt-get -y install libgsl0-dev libncurses5-dev libreadline-dev gfortran libfreetype6-dev libblas-dev liblapack-dev r-base python-rpy
   pip install scipy matplotlib PIL NeuroTools mpi4py xmlrunner

Then, you install nest::

   wget http://www.nest-initiative.org/download/gplreleases/nest-2.2.2.tar.gz
   tar xvzf nest-2.2.2.tar.gz
   cd nest-2.2.2
   ./configure --with-mpi --prefix=/opt/nest --with-pynest-prefix=/usr
   make
   make install
   python -c 'import nest'

You install pyNN (version 0.8 from the github NeuralEnsemble repository)::

   cd
   git clone https://github.com/NeuralEnsemble/PyNN.git PyNN-8
   cd PyNN-8
   python setup.py install
   python -c 'import pyNN.nest as sim'


Installation of the ESS
-----------------------

You should first obtain an account from heidelberg. Then, on your computer, you generate a rsa key::

   ssh-keygen -t rsa

Suppose that you have saved the key in the file ~/.ssh/id_rsa. In the heidelberg website, you go to 'My account' (upper-right). You click on 'Public Key' in the upper-right corner. You click on 'New value' and paste the content of your computer's id_rsa.pub. Wait until the activation is done.

Then, you can download and install the ESS on your computer::

   cd
   git clone git@brainscales-r.kip.uni-heidelberg.de:symap2ic.git
   cd symap2ic
   . bootstrap.sh.UHEI .
   ./waf set_config systemsim-pynn8
   ./waf update

If you have had problems in the execution of the 4 lines above, you have some read access right problems from the repositories. Please consult Eric MÃ¼ller or the person in charge from Heidelberg. Please now go on by configuring and installing the system::

   ./waf configure --stage=brainscales --use-systemsim --without-hardware --prefix=$HOME/symap2ic
   ./waf install

You now set the environment variables::

   echo 'export SYMAP2IC_PATH=$HOME/symap2ic' >> ~/.bashrc
   echo 'export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:$SYMAP2IC_PATH/lib' >> ~/.bashrc
   echo 'export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$SYMAP2IC_PATH/lib' >> ~/.bashrc
   bash

You test that the hardware backend is accessible::

   python -c 'import pyNN.hardware.brainscales as sim'

To test your installation, you can run the PyNN 0.8 unit- and system tests::

   cd ~/PyNN-8/test
   cd unittests/backends
   nosetests test_mock.py
   nosetests test_hardware_brainscales.py
